# MyWay-CLI: The must-have tool for MyWay

The MyWay CLI allows users to create, modify, run and test projects using the [MyWay Sinatra Framework](https://github.com/jonjondev/myway-sinatra) using the simple `myway` command.

## Installation

Simply run the following in console to install:

```bash
$ gem install myway-cli
```

## Usage

To create a new project:

```bash
$ myway generate project example-project
```

To run the server:

```bash
$ myway run server
```

To run test:

```bash
$ myway run tests
```

To introduce a new controller, api or model:

```bash
$ myway generate controller example_controller
$ myway generate api example_api
$ myway generate model example_model
```

*Note: command segments can be run with just the first letter of their name*

*e.g. running the server can be accomplished with  `myway r s`*
